# Sonnet - The Default Choice

## Summary

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the default model for Claude Code, offering excellent balance of capability, speed, and cost for general software development.

## Why Sonnet is Default

**Balanced Performance**:
- Fast enough for interactive work
- Capable enough for most tasks
- Cost-effective for daily use

**Versatile**:
- Handles 90% of development tasks
- Good at both planning and execution
- Reliable for production use

## What Sonnet Handles Well

### Daily Development
- Feature implementation
- Code reviews
- Bug fixes
- Testing
- Documentation
- Refactoring (moderate complexity)

### Typical Tasks
- API endpoints
- Database queries
- UI components
- Business logic
- Integration code

## When Sonnet Struggles

Upgrade to Opus when:
- Sonnet gives generic/confused answers
- Complex architectural decisions needed
- Large multi-file refactors
- Deep debugging required

Downgrade to Haiku when:
- Simple, repetitive operations
- Speed is priority
- Cost matters more than quality

## Performance Sweet Spot

Sonnet excels at:
- 2-10 file modifications
- Standard design patterns
- Common frameworks
- Moderate complexity

## Cost-Effectiveness

~3x cost of Haiku, ~1/5 cost of Opus

Best value for general development work.

## Key Takeaway

Keep Sonnet as your default. It handles most work well. Only switch when you have a specific reason (complexity → Opus, speed → Haiku).
